# Formal group laws arising from  algebraic varieties

This is the repository of my Master&rsquo;s Thesis, supervised by Professor Christian Liedtke. It must be presented by the 15<sup>th</sup> of July, 2024. It is about the formal Brauer group, that arises from &eacute;tale cohomology groups.

Artin and Mazur[^1] defined a new formal group on algebraic varieties: the so-called formal Brauer group. On elliptic surfaces, Artin[^2] gived a relation between the height of the formal Brauer group and the coefficients of the Weierstrass equation that define the surface. Later, Ito and Liedtke[^3] provided a relation between the height of this formal group and the number of fibres with potentially supersingular reduction in elliptic K3 surfaces with *p*-torsion sections.
